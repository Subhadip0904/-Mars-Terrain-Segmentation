# Mars-Terrain-Segmentation
This project aims to segment Mars terrain using deep learning. The dataset consists of 64x128 grayscale satellite images, where each pixel is classified into one of five terrain categories. We built a U-Net-based segmentation model to achieve precise pixel-level classification, improving its generalization using data augmentation and loss function
